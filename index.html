                        <p>Academic literacy practices exist within diverse cultural and linguistic contexts. Different knowledge traditions offer valuable perspectives on meaning-making, argumentation, and knowledge construction. Understanding these variations enriches academic communication by expanding the range of acceptable forms and challenging monolingual or monocultural assumptions.</p>
                        <p>Global academic communication benefits from recognising multiple ways of knowing and communicating. This includes valuing different narrative structures, argumentation styles, and approaches to evidence. Such recognition supports more inclusive academic communities where diverse voices can contribute meaningfully to knowledge production. Approaches that position academic literacy as a fixed set of skills often overlook the rich diversity of knowledge traditions that can enhance academic discourse.</p>
